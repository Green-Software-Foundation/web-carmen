          Carmen (Carbon Measurement Engine) is an open-source tool that measures the carbon footprint of cloud-based software at two critical levels. Built by Amadeus engineers and contributed to the Green Software Foundation, Carmen provides accurate, actionable data to help organizations understand and reduce their cloud computing environmental impact.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl">
          At the infrastructure level, Carmen monitors energy consumption and emissions from virtual machines and cloud services. At the application level, it tracks the carbon footprint of individual Kubernetes pods and workloads. By integrating with your existing Prometheus monitoring and leveraging the Impact Framework, Carmen transforms complex metrics into clear carbon emissions data—enabling you to identify high-carbon workloads, optimize resource allocation, and track sustainability improvements over time.
